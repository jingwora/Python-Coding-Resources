## Python Best Practices for Better Code

This guide introduces Python best practices, from the foundational PEP 8 standards to advanced techniques for code formatting, logging, commenting, and documentation. 

- What is PEP 8?
  - Style guide for Python promoting readability and consistency.
  - Created by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan in 2001.
  - Highly recommended for the Python community.

- Python Best Practices for Code Quality
  - Importance of indentation in Python.
  - Adhere to PEP 8's recommendation of 79 characters per line.
  - Use blank lines for organizing code. Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
  - Utilize linters and formatters for code quality.
  - Familiarize with Python principles like the Zen of Python.

- Python Logging
  - Logging for tracking events during software run.
  - Differences between logging and the print function.
  - Importance of choosing appropriate logging levels.
  - Benefits of using timestamps and managing log storage.

- Python Commenting
  - Update comments to avoid inconsistency with code.
  - Write clear, complete sentences in English.
  - Distinguish between block comments (explain following code) and inline comments (same line as code).

- Python Docstring Best Practices
  - Docstrings provide documentation for modules, functions, classes, and methods.
  - Enclosed in triple double quotes.
  - Two forms: one-liners and multi-line docstrings.

- Python Documentation Best Practices
  - Use README files as main entry points for code.
  - Always include a setup.py file for software distribution.
  - List dependencies in requirements.txt files.
  - Provide examples of software usage.

- Python Virtual Environment Best Practices
  - Create a virtual environment for each project.
  - Virtual environments isolate project-specific versions of Python, libraries, and pip.
  - Use virtualenv package for environment creation.

- Python Naming Conventions
  - Proper naming of variables, classes, functions is crucial for readability.
  - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for naming.
  - Avoid general or non-ASCII names; prioritize internal consistency.
